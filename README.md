### Master the Frontend with the Tic-Tac-Toe to Sudoku Challenge!
#### I. Tic-Tac-Toe
  1. Implement Tic-Tac-Toe game using React **class components**.
  2. Refactor to use **function components** and **useState**, **useEffect** hooks.
  3. Refactor to use **Context API** and **useReducer**.
#### II. Sudoku
  1. Using TypeScript, refactor into **Generic Components** and generalize to implement any Sudoku game of arbitrary order (dimension).
  2. Write **Backtracking Algorithm** and **Custom Hooks** to handle game logic. 
  3. Rewrite into two-player competitive game. Write solver so that it switches mid-game from verifying the legality of each player's moves (**NP**) to memoizing and updating the set of remaining legal moves (**P**) at each turn.
  4. Generalize for n players.
#### III. Global State Management
  1. Refactor to use **Redux** and **RTK** to handle global state.
  2. Refactor to use **Zustand** and **Immler** to handle global state.
#### IV. Online Multiplayer
  1. Write **Async Middleware** and deploy **REST API** to implement turn-based gameplay.
  2. Refactor to use **GraphQL Subscriptions** deployed over **AWS Lambda** instead.
  3. Write **WebSockets** event handlers and emitters for real-time cursor position sharing.
